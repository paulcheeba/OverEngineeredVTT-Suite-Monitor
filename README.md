The OverEngineeredVTT Suite Monitor can be dismissed or hidden until the next OEV module update, when there is an updated OEV module the hidden status will be reset to false and the monitor will be visible.

At any time the GM can check for updates by clicking the button in the OverEngineered Suite Monitor settings:
